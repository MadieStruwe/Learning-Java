# Learning-Java
Personal repo for my files to learn Java

This is my repo for files I have made to start learning java.
The tutorial I follwed (so far) can be found at https://www.learnjavaonline.org/

To install java I used the following commands in the terminal (for linux)

sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y

sudo apt-get install default-jre
