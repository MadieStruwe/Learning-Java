# Learning-Java
Personal repo for my files to learn Java

This is my repo for files I have made to start learning java.
The tutorial I follwed (so far) can be found at https://www.learnjavaonline.org/

To install java I used the following commands in the terminal (for linux)

sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y

sudo apt-get install default-jre

This is my GitHub that contains school work and projects I have or am working on. My intention of creating this account is so I can show employers work I have done and how I have progressed as a programmer. Please do not copy any code, files, or parts there of. I do not give concent for people to not use my work unless either I have given concent or the code in here is already open source and free to use. Do NOT remove the credits of open source code or citations.
